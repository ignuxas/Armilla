      </h3>
      <div className="margin-point5rem 0">
        No waiver by us of any term or condition set forth in Terms shall
        be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a
        waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of us to
        assert a right or provision under Terms shall not constitute a waiver of
        such right or provision.

      <div className="margin-point5rem 0">
        If any provision of Terms is held by a court or other tribunal of
        competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any
        reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum
        extent such that the remaining provisions of Terms will continue in full
        force and effect.
